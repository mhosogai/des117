        <h2>Biography</h2>
        
        <p>Hayao Miyazaki, director of many Ghibli works, is one of Japan's greatest animation directors. His breath taking works not only earned him a public recognition in Japan, but also world wide. Some of his greater hits such as Ponyo, Howl's Moving Castle, and Spirited Away were even introduced by the Walt Disney Company to promote worldwide and allow more people to show appreciation of his high-quality works.</p>

        <p>Hayao Miyazaki was born in <strong> Tokyo, Japan </strong> on January 5, <em>1941</em>. He began his animator career at the Toei Douga studio in the year 1963, and gained popularity fast because of his incredible drawing skills and endless movie idea proposals. He started his own Studio Ghibli after receiving lots of recognition for his movie success, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind in the year 1984 and continued to excel in his career.</p>

        <p>In addition to his animation career, Miyazaki was also a manga artist. His major work also started with the Nausicaa manga mentioned previously. Although his manga drawing skills were exceptional, he did not focus much on drawing manga since his animation career took up most of his time. Miyazaki is still presently living today, however he has retired after directing his last film, The Wind Rises in 2013.</p>
